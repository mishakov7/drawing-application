# Drawing Application

https://mishalukov-draw.netlify.app/

This application incorporates the use of several tools (brush, eraser, fill tool, color picker) to creeate a comprehensive drawing application. As time goes on, I will continue to add more features and tools.

Currently planned for the future:
- Allow option to change colors in palette + add more colors to palette
- Optimize application for mobile
- Layering functionality
- More tools (lasso, marquee)

Along with that, I will fix the current flaws:
- Filling the background with black...

And refactor the code with an object-oriented approach.
